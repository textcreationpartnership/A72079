         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:150905:9"/> more bolde, that béeing wearie with trauell, he laide himſelfe downe to ſléepe, and when he awooke, being very hungrie, he gathered wilde fruite, whereof there was plentie, which was his foode, and the cleare water his drinke. This was his habitation a long time, taking great pleaſure to hunt and chaſe the wilde beaſts, from whoſe furie he was ſtill preſerued by the Lyon. Afterwards when he was growen to riper age, in his ſléepe he drempt, that his nurſe appeared vnto him, willing him to forſake that vnfrequented place, and to ſeeke out <hi>Andramarts</hi> Caſtle, where he ſhould finde people, in whoſe companie he ſhould bée brought vp.</p>
               <p>When he awaked, he could not tel what to thinke of his dreame, nor what ſhe ment by <hi>Andramarts</hi> Caſtle, nor which way to goe thither, being therewith drawne into a deepe ſtudie, but ſuddainly hée eſpied a young Beare, whoſe ſight made him quite forget his dreame, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king excéeding delight to chaſe ſuch beaſtes, he caught vp his ſtafie and followed her, and purſued her ſo fiercely, that at length hee ſlewe her: wherewith he was wandred ſo farre, that getting to the top of a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and looking round about him, he eſpied the Caſtle, thinking that was the place his nurſe had tolde him of in his dreame, that hee went thitherwardes. It chanced one of the knights that <hi>Pariſmus</hi> had left to kéepe the Caſtle, eſpied him: and béeing of a ſadde diſpoſition, ſéeing <hi>Pariſmenos</hi> begin to withdraw himſelfr, ranne to him, and offered to lay hands on him. But <hi>Pariſmenos</hi> being afraid of his behauior, ſtrook at him with his ſtaffe ſo fiercely, that had he not quickly auoyded his blowe, he had beaten out his braines. The Tartarian beeing angrie, drewe his ſword, and therewith wounded <hi>Pariſmenos</hi> in the thigh, the ſmart whereof ſo inraged him, that notwithſtanding all his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, he left him for dead.</p>
               <p>Afterwards entring the Caſtle, his winde was drawne into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding delight, to behold the goodly buildings and beautie thereof.

               <p>THe Bohemian Knights, by commandement of <hi>Pariſmus,</hi> and the Theſſalian knights, for the affection they bare to <hi>Violetta,</hi> hauing
<pb facs="tcp:150905:15"/> poſted through euery part of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and made all diligent ſearch, leauing no place vnſought, no means vnattempted, nor labour vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to finde her: yet notwithſtanding all their faithfull diligence, at laſt returned without any newes of her at all: which renewed <hi>Pollipus</hi> ſorrowes afreſh, that but euen then had entertained a little quiet by <hi>Pariſmus</hi> perſwaſions. But when he ſawe <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ioletta</hi> was by no meanes to be heard of, nor any likelihood or comfort left for him euer to ſée her againe: neither knowing nor any way ſuppoſing what ſhuld be become of her, his heart was ſo inwardly ouercome with trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome cogitations and doubtfull cares, that he could neither reſolue to ſeeke her, nor take any courſe to eaſe his minde: but reſted like one vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly giuen ouer, to forlorne and careleſſe miſerie, daylie frequenting thoſe ſollitary walkes where he left her, and hourely renewing his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, by the ſad remembrance of her abſence, vttering ſuch mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full plaints and ſad lamentations, that the birds that haunted thoſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequented places, ſéemed to mourn and lament with him. Sometimes accuſing himſelfe of negligence, to leaue her, to purſue the Beare, bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming her that would not ſtay his returne, and then againe, fretting his heart for accuſing her. Sometimes thinking ſhe was dead, and then againe perſwading himſelfe ſhée was aliue, then muſing why ſhe did not returne to him if ſhe were aliue: that by contrarieties of doubts, he could adde no eaſe to his cares, nor reſt to his heart, at laſt hée deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ſearch throughout all <hi>Germanie</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> but hée would find her: for he aſſuredly thought ſhe was not dead, being therto indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, for that he could not finde no likelihood thereof, being perſwaded by <hi>Pariſmus,</hi> that ſome diſcurteous knight had met with her, and ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held her returne: that within fewe dayes (arming himſelfe in a gréene armour, which he made of purpoſe, bearing this deuice; <hi>A knight pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing a wilde Beare)</hi> he left the Bohemian Court, making none priuie to his departure but <hi>Pariſmus,</hi> (who determined not to ſtay long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde him) whom we wil leaue onwards of his iourney, and ſpeake of <hi>Violetta,</hi> whom we left weake in <hi>Archas</hi> Caſtle.</p>
               <p>Aſſoone as the two gentlewomen had conueyed her to her bed, with the comfortable meanes they vſed, ſhe began to be ſomewhat reuiued, and calling her ſences to their wonted vſes, began to make ſuch dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full lamentations, that no hart was able to indure to heare them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out effuſion of teares: oftentimes offering to do her ſelfe violence, but
<pb facs="tcp:150905:16"/> that ſhe was hindred by the two gentlewomen: eſpecially one of them named <hi>Sorana,</hi> was ſo carefull ouer her, that ſhe left not ſo much as a pinne about her, wherewith ſhe might do her ſelfe harme: but when ſome thrée dayes were paſt, and the extremitie of her deſperate paſſion ſomewhat calmed, ſhe began to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Moſt beautifull Lady, I haue euer ſince the firſt viewe of thoſe excellent bewties, béene tormented with the paſſions of entire loue, that I could take no quiet, but in the ſweete remembrance of your perfections, which haue bounde my deuotions to your ſeruice, in ſuch firme and conſtant leagues, that my reſolution is, to ſpend my life (if it were a thouſand times dearer to mée then it is) onely to procure your content: therefore thus boldlie I preſume to reueale my affections, truſting your clemencie will adde ſome eaſe to my carefull heart, by ſhewing ſome curteous ſigne of your fauourable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of my humble ſuite: and though my merit hath no way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued ſuch fauour, yet I beſéech you, make tryall of my loyaltie,
<pb facs="tcp:150905:16"/> and you ſhall finde I will be inferior to none in good will, nor violate myproteſted loyaltie in any vndutifull reſpect. I haue the boldlier pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to detaine you here, becauſe with your abſence my life would depart: then conſture not amiſſe of that true loue and ſincere affection which hath cauſed me to offend in, but no offence at all, if you vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe not to take it ſo: here ſhall you inioy you fill of content, in as ample ſort as any other place can yeelde: then I beſeech you graunt ſome eaſe to my troubled heart, and by your clemencie releaſe mée of thoſe cares that poſſeſſe my breſt, onely procured by the piercing dart of your ſacred beautie. Which wordes beeing ended, hée offered to haue kiſt her, but ſhée gentlie refuſing the ſame, made this replie.</p>
               <p>Syr knight, my ſorrows will not ſuffer me to beléeue your ſpéeches, nor my late loſſe, permit me to entertaine your loue: for then might you eſtéeme me light, and ſo lightly wonne, as little regard mee: but to put you out of ſuſpence, my reſolution is, neuer to loue any but my deare <hi>Pollipus:</hi> wherewith the Chriſtall teares with a violent paſſage, fell from her griefe ſwollen eye-balls.</p>
               <p>That griefe quoth he, is remedileſſe: therefore baniſh the ſad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance thereof from your heart, and entertaine a perſwaſion of my conſtancie, and true affection, which ſhal euerlaſtingly remaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiolable, without intermiſſion.</p>
               <p>How can I (quoth ſhe) in conſcience, and without euerlaſting ſtaine to my honour, when I haue neither performed his funerall, nor ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any token of dutie to his dead corpes, who loued me moſt dearely in his life time. But ſhew me this fauour, as to let me but returne to the Court to bewaile his death, and a while enioy my deare friendes company, and I promiſe and proteſt next <hi>Pollipus,</hi> to loue none but your ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Archas</hi> hearing her reaſonable demaund, ſtoode like one ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, not knowing what aunſwere to make her, thinking that if hee ſhoulde denie her that requeſt béeing ſo ſmall, ſhee might thinke his loue but ſlender: and if hee ſhould promiſe her, and not performe it, that might bee a meanes to breede a ſuſpition in her, that his reports to her were falſe: that he ſtoode muſing a great while confounded in his thoughts, what to deuiſe for a readie aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were.</p>

Which words came from her with ſuch ſtutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and change of countenance, that <hi>Violetta</hi> began to ſuſpect, that <hi>Archas</hi> had all that while diſſembled with her, and that <hi>Pollipus</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his report) was yet liuing. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Sorana</hi> came, ſhe likewiſe felt her minde, of whom ſhe gathered ſome probabilitie: and likewiſe, when ſhée next came into <hi>Archas</hi> company, ſhée aſked him ſo many queſtions, that ſhée found many contrarieties in his ſpéeches, which ſetled ſuch a perſwaſiue opinion in her minde, that <hi>Archas</hi> report of <hi>Pollipus</hi> was vntrue, that ſhe reſted greatly comforted that way, but yet in great care, cogitating what he wold ſuppoſe was become of her, how ſhe ſhuld get out of that place, or giue him knowledge of her being there, and auoyde <hi>Archas</hi> odious loue, which ſéemed as deadly to her heart as infectious venome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Archas</hi> ſtill proſecuted his ſute with great earneſtneſſe, making ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny friuolous excuſes to withhold her from the Bohemian court, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into ſuch boldneſſe, that oftentimes when ſhe refuſed his offered embracings and impudent behauiours, he would by force kiſſe her, and ſold her in his armes, which rudeneſſe, he ſo often vſed, that ſhe began ſo extreamely to abhorre him, that his ſight was moſt odious vnto her.</p>
               <p>Oftentimes <hi>Violetta</hi> did walke into a pleaſant Orchard adioyning to the Caſtle, as well to recreate her dulled ſences in thoſe pleaſant ſhades, as in ſolitarineſſe to recount her miſeries, and eaſe her carefull heart by inuenting meanes how to ridde her ſelfe from forth that laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth of ſorrow, and alſo to auoyd <hi>Archas</hi> odious ſight, who inwardly luſted to ſatiſfie his inordinate appetite, by obtaining the fruition of her dilicate body: and though he knew <hi>Pollipus</hi> were liuing, and heard the mones and ſorrowfull complaints <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ioletta</hi> made, able to extenuate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tyrannous diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet he perſiſted in his diuelliſh reſolution, with ſuch impudency, that neither regarding her complaints, nor the lawes
<pb facs="tcp:150905:17"/> of nature, he ſtil ſought all diſloyal opportunities to diſhonour her. And on a time, marking whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe went into the Orchard, as ſhe was wont, in middeſt of her ſilent cogitations, he came to the place where ſhe ſate, (whoſe hart began to pant with a kind of feare, when ſhe beheld him) and comming vnto her, ſeating himſelfe cloſe by her ſwéet ſide, he vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red theſe ſpéeches.</p>
               <p>You know deare Lady, how long I haue ſued to obtaine your loue, being thereto compelled by the extremities of loues euerlaſting flame, which boileth in my troubled breſt, but hitherto you haue obdurated your heart againſt me, and not vouchſafed to yéelde any pitty to my diſtreſſe, but contrary to the kinde nature that ſhould abound in you, ſéeme not at all to regard my paſſions, which hath added ſorrow to my torment. Now ſwéete Lady, ſéeing with what denotions I haue atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded your pleaſure, defer me no longer, but let me obtaine that faoour, which with ſuch care I haue expected, and you ſo vnkindly withheld: which wold both eaſe my comfortleſſe heart, and adde no ſmall content to the remedileſſe ſorrowes you ſo impatiently endure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Violetta</hi> hearing his ſpéeches, made this replie. Sir, I haue long ſince told you my reſolution, which might be a ſufficient anſwer to any reaſonable creature: beſides, my vowes paſſed to my deare knight <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipus,</hi> haue bound me from yéelding my ſpotleſſe honour to bee ſtained with the blot of infamie. Then I pray leaue off to proſecute your ſute, which you ground vpon loues foundation, béeing indéede, nothing but the inſatiate deſire of filthy concupiſence, the remembrance whereof, addeth new care to my carefull heart, and euery way affrighteth mée with diſcontent: and if you ſo much regard my content, as you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, deſiſt to trouble me with your loue, and giue me leaue to depart from hence, that I may ſpend the reſt of my dayes in ſorrowe, for his loſſe, that was more deare vnto me, then all the worlds treaſure.</p>
               <p>I but Lady quoth <hi>Archas,</hi> calme this diſcontent with remembrance of an impoſſibilitie in obtaining ought at his hands, and goe not about to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſume thoſe heauenly perfections with ſorrow, &amp; ſéeme not ſtranger then reaſon requireth, to him that loueth you as well as <hi>Pollipus</hi> euer did: and now that occaſion hath ſo fitly offered the ſwéet opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of time and place, let vs ſpend this time in loue, and not in theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions: theſe vnfrequented pathes adde meanes to further our ioies: here are no eyes to behold vs, nor any to bewray our ſecrets, but the ſilent trées &amp; ſwéet ſmelling flowers: &amp; that which is vnknown, is in a

               <p>Moſt diſcourteous villaine, hath my lenitie inforced thée to offer me this abuſe: or is thy minde ſo far from pietie, as not to deſiſt from proſecuting thy deteſted luſt? knowe this, that rather then I will yéelde my honour to bée blemiſhed by thy appetite, I will teare theſe eyes from forth my head, and ende my woful life, which thou ſoughteſt to ſpill. Is this the friendſhip thou haſt proteſted? was it thy pollicie to traine mée hither to diſhonour mée? hadſt thou left me in the place where I loſt my beloued, then had I béene happie, if ſome wilde beaſt had ended my life. I now perceiue thy proteſtations are but filthy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of thy intended villanie, and all which thou haſt told me of <hi>Polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> death, to be moſt falſe and vntrue: for no doubt, hée is yet liuing, whom thou ſéekeſt to diſhonour, by diſpoyling me of that which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued for him.

               <p>The king hauing againe in moſt ſumptuous and royal ſort, ſeated his daughter vpon the ſcaffold, attended the firſt encounter that ſhould be giuen to the knight of <hi>Fame,</hi> which was performed by <hi>Parrus,</hi> a

Knights (quoth he) what meaneth this outrage? why contend you betwixt your ſelues, and leaue me, with whom you ſhould principally deale, vnaſſayed? thinke you I am not of ſufficiencie to deale with you both? but that you muſt thus diſhonourably, ſeeke with priuate quarrels to diſturbe our triall? But notwithſtanding his ſpeeches, they began to aſſayle each other againe, which ſo inraged him, that drawing his ſword, he firſt ſtrooke at <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> and then at <hi>Drio,</hi> offering to combat with them both, that the iſſue of this combat ſéemed to be moſt intricate.

               <p>The King perceiuing what danger this tripartite fight might bréed, commanded the Champions to be parted, which being done, the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges gaue order, that the knight of Fame ſhould continue his courſe with <hi>Drio.</hi> This concluſion being made, the knight of Fame ſheathing his ſword, went to the races end ſo fully incenſt with rage, that his eyes ſmarted with vexation. <hi>Drio</hi> likewiſe was ſo fully puft with fury, that he vowed at that courſe to ende the triall of the combat: that both of them taking ſcope ynough, to méete with the greater ſwiftneſſe, ſet ſpurs to their ſtéeds ſides, and with excéeding violence, and ſhiuering their Lances into a thouſand ſpelles, which ſung in the ayre: before the ſteeds met, <hi>Drio</hi> wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Phylena</hi> with a bluſhing countenaunce, made this ſhort replie: Moſt noble Knight, <hi>Remulus</hi> is the knight I haue long eſtéemed, but muſt now forſake him, or purchaſe my parents diſcontent, and denie you the right of your conqueſt. The Knight of <hi>Fame</hi> ſmiling at the inward conceit of his Viſion, made this anſwere.

Curteous Knight, your intereſt in this Lady, is greater then mine, for you haue her heart, and I but her hand: which I ſurrender vnto you, with all the ſtate I can claime in her by right of conqueſt: and ſo effectually will I deale with the King, to your liking, that he ſhall confirme that to you, which I ſhould poſſeſſe by his graunt. <hi>Remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> hearing his ſpéeches, was ſo reuiued with ioy, that he could not tel what anſwere to make him, and <hi>Phylenas</hi> heart lept within her, being moſt glad, fortune had effected that meanes for her, to enioy her deare knight <hi>Remulus.</hi>

               <p>The Knight of <hi>Fame</hi> on the contrary ſide, gouerned himſelfe with more moderation, for he hauing attained ſuch good ſucceſſe as his heart did wiſh, was therewith for the preſent contented: hoping that fortune that had béene ſo fauourable to him, would not ſuddainely alter her countenance, but ſtill contiune her ayde to his furtherance: whom <hi>Maximus</hi> likewiſe diligently noted, hauing ſuſpition that hée likewiſe came for <hi>Augelicas</hi> loue, though hée diſſembled the contrary, of which he could perceiue no likelihood by his merrie countenance, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him onely to ſuſpect <hi>Camillus,</hi> and not him.</p>

               <p>Afterwards they went to their repaſt, with ſuch ſparing diet as the Prieſt vſed, and after ſupper to bedde: where the knight of <hi>Fame</hi> could take no reſt at all, but yet lay very quietly, becauſe he was loth to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his Hoſt: with which reſtraint of libertie of ſpéech and other paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that oppreſt his ſences, he indured that tedious night in great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ſéemed longer then many nights would haue done, if hée might haue had libertie to vtter his lamentations, which boyled in his breaſt like the violence of a mightie flame pend within a ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe.</p>
               <p>Early the next morning, <hi>Iabine</hi> went forth for to prouide foode, and left the knight of <hi>Fame</hi> alone, who then vttered many complaints, but at laſt finding fault with himſelfe for vrging that effeminate kind of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, he ſtriuing to ouermaiſter his paſſions, which the more he
